      intro: "Building a new product requires an innate understanding of how users will understand your product, interact with your product and remember your product",
      project: "For this project, I (along with 3 classmates) were tasked with creating an interface for a new startup that we were unfamiliar with, but the caveat was we were not allowed to look at how the startup implemented their product. Rather, we had to use the company's mission statement and product descriptions to build an interface. Afterwards, we solicited feedback from peers and real user-testers.",
      methodology: ["In order to begin this project, we had to find a new startup to design a product for. Using YCombinator's database, we discovered InTuned: a tool aimed to help software engineering managers track the progress of their team and customize what data they track. Without knowledge of how InTuned implemented their interface, we utilized Figma and Balsmic to create prototypes", "After creating designs, we then took feedback from peers in our class to then create a final product. We then utilized UserTesting.com to test our assumptions of how users would utilize our interface"],
      goals: ["Understand what InTuned's key features were", "Build low-fi and hi-fi interfaces to maximize InTuned's capabilities", "Incorporate user feedback to drive our design process"],
      skills: "User Experience Research, Figma, Prototyping",
      challenges: "The biggest challenge of this assignment was to try to understand how to physically design some of the features that InTuned described. InTuned had described features of querying external applications to receive data and tracking employee data, but we had little idea how to design such a process in an effective way. It took a lot of deliberating during the prototyping phase",
      results: ["We believe our Figma designed truly captured the potential of what an integrated-workflow for engineering managers would look like", "However, what we did learn from some feedback, was that the exact placement of certain widgets (ie: a modal, a notification bar) really dictated where people's eyes were drawn", "Our user testing mostly confiremd our assumptions, but we did make a few alterations along the way, showing us how iterative design really is", "Overall, we believe we designed an effective system to serve InTuned's purpose. We, actually, emailed the co-founders of InTuned and received great feedback!"],

      intro: "React is a powerful tool that uses a variety of features (components, states and hooks) that allow for dynamic websites. Thus, mastery of component-based design in React provides a limitless amount of options for creating a true user experience",
      project: "For this project, I was tasked with creating a React application that worked like an e-commerce website. The application needed to use Component-based design and state variables to do the following: create a list of product cards, allow users to filter through these cards by some criteria as well as be able to sort the cards by some criteria, and to create a component that allowed users to aggregate information",
      methodology: ["Based on the project description, I decided to create an e-commerce based website, as it felt that the project guidelines fit perfectly for an e-commerce use case. Due to my love of Thai food, I decided to create my own dataset compromised of Thai Food and create a hypothetical Thai resturant", "In order to create each component, I utilized React components (creating a component for the FilterBar, Aggregator and ItemCard). Using state variables, I was able to get filtering and sorting working", "To style the components, I utilized CSS and Bootstrap CSS. I stuck to a mostly green theme to keep the styling simple"],

      skills: "React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Website Design",
      challenges: "The biggest challenge of this assignment was navigating React, a language which I did have some past experience in, but have not used consistently. Specifically, I found it frustrating trying to integrate React with navigation elements, as I could not get many of my filtering functions to function. After some experimentation with the Bootstrap elements, I figured out how to integrate my React functions with their respective div elements",
      results: ["Overall, I believe I was successful in learning how to use a variety of technologies (Boostrap, React) to create a functional website", "If I had more time, I would like to add more interactivity and styling to this website, as I kept it very simple to focus on the use of the technology"],

      intro: "With users utilizing a range of devices (tablet, phone, computer, desktop, console) to access interfaces, it is important to consider how one's design scales across devices to maximize utility for all users. If one doesn't, this may lead to a very confusing and frustrating interface.",
      project: "For this assignment for CS1300: UI/UX, I was tasked with finding and rebuilding a poorly-designed web UI page. I had to identify why the website was poor and then design an alternative interface for the website that also scaled for mobile and tablet usage. After building low-fi and hi-fi prototypes with my design, I had to utilize HTML and CSS to actually create my website.",
      methodology: ["After doing some research, the website I chose to redesign was Argren.net, a Norwegian based e-commerce website. Argren.net tries to emulate the look of a 'yellow-pages' type website, but struggles to do so in a cohesive way, instead making the interface cluttered, confusing and sometimes non-sensical. The design was so poor that it felt to be almost a satirical example of bad design", "First, I identifyed a variety of issues with the website's usability (bas layout, no product organization, repetition, etc.) and accessibility.", "In order to fix this issues, I created a variety of low-fi and hi-fi wireframes that solved the issues at hand", "In order to create a consistent appearance across the website, I decided on a style guide to create a theme that defined the website's style", "After doing this pre-eliminary design work, I utilized Figma to create a hi-fi prototype for mobile, desktop and tablet interfaces", "Then, utilizing my knowledge of HTML and CSS, I attempted to implement my prototype"],

      skills: "Protoyping, UI Fundamentals, Accessibility, Figma, HTML, CSS, Responsive Device Development",
      challenges: "The biggest challenge I faced with this assignment was the fact that the website, itself, was cluttered with a lot of information and junk, that any future iteration felt that it would be cluttered. Because the website was almost comical in its design, there was little consistency across the items. However, as a designer, it felt that the nature of the website was comical. Many of the products involved low-quality photos and random products (such as an ad to produce a Norwegian sci-fi film in the middle of the page). Thus, I wanted to highlight this persona in the future redesign. Balancing the personality of the past website and the need for massive change proved to be difficult",
      results: ["I believe that there were portions of this assignment I performed well on and portions of this assignment that taught me what I need to improve on", "I think I was very strong and identifying what design flaws occured on Argren's website and why they limited usability/accessibility", "I also believe I grasped Figma pretty well and learnt how to re-use Figma components and grouping to create multiple interfaces quickly","However, I believe that my proposed design ended up being a bit cluttered because of my limited exposure with media queries and CSS styling", "In the future, if I re-did this assignment, I realized that I needed to utilize more CSS-styling options (grid, flex, containers) and try to limit the width of text on the screen. I believe my failure to do so created some issues", "Furthermore, for this assignment, we did not need to create interactive components. With my current knowledge of React, I believe I would be able to build interactive components now."],

      intro: "Sports Betting is one of the most profitable ventures that Deep Learning techniques have been applied to. Theoretically, a model whose performance can consistently identify profitable bets against Vegas' Line would have major implications. With some existing precedent and papers in the field, it is clear that there is real potential for a Deep Learning approach to identifying profit in sports games",
      project: "For this project, we were given a fairly open-ended assignment: Use a Deep Learning technique to investigate a use-case of DL. As a passionate NBA fan, I (along with 3 other teammates), chose to try to implement a deep learning model that utilized pre-game and live-game statistical information to predict the final winner and final score of the game. Thus, the two betting metrics we aimed to look at were the moneyline and the spread. If we could identify arbitrage opportunities against the line with consistency, our model stood to be very powerful",
      methodology: ["While we theorized about many ideas and models to experiment with, we ended up producing 2 separate models that predicted the outcome of NBA games. Given that we thought of the project with the application of betting in mind, we thought about two important distinctions between a bet: a bet can be made either before a game (pre-game bet) or during the game (a live bet).", "For the pre-game-bet model, we extracted data from an API endpoint from Sportsrader.com. To speed up extraction, we utilize multithreaded API calls that allowed us to get data on every player, NBA game, and team from the 2013-14 NBA season", "After formatting the data in different manners, we ran the data through a variety of dense layers", "For each task, we chose to use different loss metrics and outputs. For the game-winner prediction (moneyline), we used Binary cross entropy across our batch as our loss function. For our margin-of-victory prediction (spread), we utilized MSE error between the predicted margin and the actual margin", "For our live-game-bet model, we extracted data from a variety of sources. To utilize the aspect of live-game information, we sourced play-by-pla data from Kaggle to use sequential play-by-play data to predict the outcome of the rest of the game. However, in order to source player and team data for each player, we had to source data via data scrapping from SportsReference.com", "In order to format our sequential play-by-play information with our player and team vectors, we required a lot of preprocessing and reshaping of the data before feeding it into a variety of architectures", "To represent play-by-play data in a lower-dimension space and in a mathematical manner, we utilized an encoder that learned a vector for play-by-play data (with features ranging from point, shot, timeout, rebound, substitution) and appended this to player and team vectors.", "Afterwards, this data was fed into 6 different models: an LSTM + Dense, CNN + LSTM Joined, 3 Different CNN + LSTM Parallel Models and a simple LSTM model that didn't utilize the player and team data", "We experimented with a variety of hyperparameters to optimize our live-betting model"],
      goals: ["Design multiple architectures to predict NBA game outcome", "Data Scraping and Preprocessing", "Maximize experimentation with hyperparameters and architecture to find a winning model", "Utilize Keras and Tensorflow to optimize design", "Create a model that performs above 50%", "Find potential expansions for project"],
      skills: "TensorFlow, Keras, Python, CNN, LSTM, Preprocessing, Neural Networks, Deep Learning Architecture, Deep Learning Design",
      challenges: "The biggest challenge of this assignment was  navigating preprocessing and formatting the data. Especially with the live-data, which dealt with data from 3 different sources in vastly different formats being fed into multiple models, most of our time was spent sourcing and formatting data in an adequate manner. Furthermore, one of the other challenges was the fact that we did not have access to live-score data per play-by-play as we expected to, meaning our model missed out on a key feature. For the pre-game-model, one source of difficulty was identifying useful features to include (which potentially could have learnable). Capturing the essence of basketball was very difficult, and correlation analysis did not seem to yield fruitful changes in results",
      results: ["Overall, the project was a success. We were very successful in identifying a variety of architectures from our class to apply it to a somewhat-new application. Our architectures were sufficiently diverse in complexity, data used and tools used.", "While our results looked very promising due to above 50%, we are a bit wary of overfitting and the model attaching to specific features (ie: It always picks the home team to win). While Vegas actually does give the home-team a distinct advantage, we felt that our model over-discriminated towards the home team", "Due to limited time in the project, we believe that we didn't have adequate time to experiment more with hyperparameters and limit overfitting. The difficulty in accessing and formatting the data slowed down a bit of our progress, but taught us a lot about data formatting", "In the future, we would choose to try a CNN on the pre-game model, experimenting more with our data formatting and actually incorporating betting information to our data, as we didn't actually utilize Vegas odds due to difficulty of extracting such information"],
